# Accelerometer
This app samples Accelerometer data from Accelerometer sensor in your Android device and filters the data using different types of filters namely-
1) Sgolay filter
2) Exponential moving Average
3) Hanning filter

It plots these filtered values using Graphview Android library(available for free).It also provides options to select filter parameters.
Happy Coding :D
